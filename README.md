# Advertising Spend Optimizer



## Special Thanks
This module builds upon an existing Databricks accelerator called “[Measure Ad Effectiveness with Multi-touch Attribution Accelerator](https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/multi-touch-attribution)”. The original Databricks accelerator is based on best practices from Databricks with leading global brands. Marketers and ad agencies are being held responsible to demonstrate ROI of their marketing dollars and optimize marketing channel spend to drive sales. The original accelerator focused solely on attribution

*The original version of this accelerator was created as an entry for Blueprint Technologies' X-Challenge. X-Challenges are designed to provide challenges that enable Blueprinters, through technical experimentation & exploration, to participate in a broad range of strategic initiatives.*
